Today is a good day.
I'm sitting next to SMK and writing this.
I have Java midterm exam today and I'm supposed to make cheat sheet
but I haven't finished making it yet.
What am I doning?
I chose to sleep early and workout in the morning and eat breakfast.
Is this the right choice?
There is no answer, but just a path that I'm walking.
So think about your action carefully and do it!
