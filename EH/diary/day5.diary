Today I worked out my legs.
It was fun and hard at the same time.
UEJ used to come in the morning, but not anymore.
Instead Orange girl comes.
SMK is really gone now. He is currently day 2.
What do I want to do with programming in the future?
How can it feed me?
I would need to think about those things.
